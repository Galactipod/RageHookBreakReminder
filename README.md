# RageHookBreakReminder

An RPH plugin that reminds you to take a break once in a while.

This plugin is very lightweight. By default, it tells you the time
every 5 minutes, tells you to take a break every 30 minutes, and tells you to
stop playing after 3 hours. All of these reminders can be disabled and their
timings can be configured.

Installation is simple. Drag and drop the contents of the `Installation Files`
folder into your `Plugins` folder. Since it's a standalone plugin, it does not
need to go in `Plugins\LSPDFR`.

**This is a beta release**, so there might be bugs. And as this is little
more than a hello-world project by an inexperienced developer, this should not
be used as a model for how an RPH plugin should be laid out. It might be
inefficient, unscalable, and insecure.
